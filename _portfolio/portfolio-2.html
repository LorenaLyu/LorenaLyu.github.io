To prototype a multispectral display demo to reproduce (visualize) a wide range of colors and wavelengths beyond the standard RGB gamut of conventional LCDs, allowing users to experience vibrant visual content for measurements from hyperspectral cameras. This type of multispectral display can serve as a study platform for investigating visual perception, hopefully leading to improved image quality and increased immersion of numerous VR/AR and medical science applications.

Intuitively, the key is to design a backlight unit that is able to shape (spread) the white LED source into multiple “rainbow” stripes and then utilize a (movable) barrier grid to select specialized wavelength bands subject to target spectra to display with a grayscale LCD panel.
