## Education
======
* Ph.D in Electrical and electronic engineering, the University of Hong Kong, 2027 (expected)
* M.S. in Electrical and electronic engineering, the University of Hong Kong, 2023
* B.S. in Optical Engineering, Nankai University, 2022

## Research experience
======
* *November 2022 - Present*: **Stereo Imaging with Learned Optics**
  * The University of Hong Kong
  * Team leader
  * Jointly optimized the optical system, image sensing system and stereo matching algorithm in an end-to-end manner with a learnable coded diffractive optical element, which is lightweight and low cost.
  * Supervisor: Evan Y. Peng

* *November 2021- June 2022*: **Grafted Optical Vortex with Controllable OAM Distribution**
  * Nankai University
  * Graduate Reseach
  * Designed and created various spatial intensity proles of a grafted optical vortex(GOV), based on the technique of computer generated holography. GOV can be used in the controllable distribution of
orbital angular momentum, which has a wide range of applications in the field of particle manipulation.
  * Supervisor: Liqin Tang

* *April 2020 - May 2021*: **New-Pattern Optical Trapping under the Longitudinal Field**
  * Nankai University
  * Team leader
  * Designed a new manipulation pattern using the chromatic aberration with different ratio of different lasers (650nm and 405nm). Manipulated on axial trap position continuously using designed double-wavelength Gaussian beam on micro target. Position of this compound optical trap will shift when changing the ratio of beam.
  * Supervisor: Qian Sun
