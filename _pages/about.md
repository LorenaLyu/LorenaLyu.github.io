I'm a first year PhD student from [Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department](https://www.eee.hku.hk/), [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Evan Y. Peng](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~evanpeng/) of [HKU WeLight Lab](https://hku.welight.fun/). My research interest includes *computational optics, computational photography, and optical system optimization*.

# Some of my Current Research:

## Stereo Deep Optics (RGBD Imaging)
======
In this project, I am seeking a high-fidelity stereo RGBD imaging paradigm that is different from traditional computer vision approaches. We utilize a shallow depth-of-field blurred image captured by a binocular simple lens system combined with optimizable diffractive optical elements (DOE) to extend the depth of field (DoF) of RGB images, improve resolution, and achieve high-resolution and high-detail depth image output with the assistance of a lightweight network. This 3D imaging system will leverage the advantages of both binocular and monocular imaging, enhance the utilization of optical coding information to improve imaging quality, and achieve a joint optimization of software and hardware.

This system has low requirements for optical hardware while being lightweight, making it suitable for adapting to low-light and complex scenes. It has potential applications in areas such as autonomous driving and virtual reality (VR).

## Current Research on Exploring Hyperspectral Display 
======
To prototype a multispectral display demo to reproduce (visualize) a wide range of colors and wavelengths beyond the standard RGB gamut of conventional LCDs, allowing users to experience vibrant visual content for measurements from hyperspectral cameras. This type of multispectral display can serve as a study platform for investigating visual perception, hopefully leading to improved image quality and increased immersion of numerous VR/AR and medical science applications. 

Intuitively, the key is to design a backlight unit that is able to shape (spread) the white LED source into multiple “rainbow” stripes and then utilize a (movable) barrier grid to select specialized wavelength bands subject to target spectra to display with a grayscale LCD panel.
