# 👩🏻‍💼 About Me
I'm a first year PhD student from [Electrical and Electronic Engineering Department](https://www.eee.hku.hk/), [The University of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/). I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Evan Y. Peng](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~evanpeng/) from the [WeLightLab@HKU](https://hku.welight.fun/) in the EEE&CS department at HKU. My research interest includes computational optics, computational photography, and optical system optimization.

You can find my CV here: [Yuhui's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/resume.pdf).

# 📔 Some of my Current Research

## 📹 [Stereo Deep Optics (RGBD Imaging)](https://lorenalyu.github.io//portfolio/portfolio-1/)

In this project, I am seeking a high-fidelity stereo RGBD imaging paradigm that is different from traditional computer vision approaches.

## 🏞️ [Exploring Hyperspectral Display](https://lorenalyu.github.io//portfolio/portfolio-2/)

We would like to design a hyperspectral display which can serve as a study platform for investigating visual perception, hopefully leading to improved image quality and increased immersion of numerous VR/AR and medical science applications.
