The course is taught by Dr. Evan Y. Peng, and I was the teaching assistant for this course in the 2023-2024 Sem 2.

This course aims at providing students with a basic understanding on artificial intelligence and deep learning technology. The topics to be covered are artificial neural networks, backpropagation, deep auto-encoder, convolutional Neural Network (CNN), recurrent Neural Network (RNN), strategies for training deep architectures, handling overfitting, cross-validation, meta-heuristic searching for parameter tuning. This is followed by hands-on implementation of deep/machine learning algorithms using Python, with applications ranging from image classification, speech processing, and financial data analysis.

After finishing the course, students will be able to
- Master the basic concept of artificial intelligence and deep learning.
- Master the Python programing language for implementing deep/machine learning models.
- Apply deep/machine learning in novel applications.
